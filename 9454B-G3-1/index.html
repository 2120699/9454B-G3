				<h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
				<p>
					<b>1. </b> The students are required to attend their classes from the first day of school.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>2. </b> No student who has been absent for three(3) class periods, and for each absence thereafter, shall re-enter the class without a readmision slip issued by the Office of the Student Affairs.		
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>3. </b> When a student has accumulated the number of absences midway the allowable limit, the classcard of the student is submitted to the Office of the Student Affairs which will notify the parent/gurdian of the student concerned. During the Short Term the classcard is submitted after every absence. The student may not go back to his class without first securing his classcard from said office.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>4. NO CLASSCARD, NO ENTRY. </b> A classcard released by the Office of the Student Affairs also serves as a readmittance pass and should be returned to the faculty by the student without delay.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>5. Call Slip. </b>No one may summon a student during class hours without official call slip issued by the School Dean, Treasurer, Registrar, Director of Libraries, Guidance Center Director, or Dean of Student Affairs.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>6. Tardiness. </b>Students are marked "late" if they arrive after the opening prayer but within the first fifteen minutes of the class period. Students who leave the class after the roll call and not return or who return only at the end of the period considered absent; those who are late for more that fifteen minutes are still marked absent in class even if they are allowed to join the class for the remainder of the period
