					<b class="" id="">Saint Louis University -</b> Baguio City (SLU) was founded in 1911 by Belgian Catholic Missionaries as a one-room school. The institution steadily grew as it opened its first college courses in 195, and obtained university status in 1963. Today, SLU has 8 schools and its the largest university in Northern Luzon. It has enjoyed full Autonomy Status since 2001 and has 8 Centers of Development and 3 Centers of Excellence. Driven by the CICM missionary goals of total service, especially to the poorest, SLU has developed a tradition of academic excellence, social responsibility, and Christian living
